# CAE_features
Continuous Acoustic Emission Features extraction is a software for computing common signal descriptors in sliding windows of a continuous acoustic recording.

# Motivation
In the wake of the OpenAE project, this software is developped to deal with **high sampling Continuous AE** data in an open and community-driven approach, based on standards for acoustic emission signal processing. 

"National and international standards like ISO 12716:2001 and ASTM E1316-17 define AE features such as amplitude, duration, rise time, counts and energy. These features, which focus on time-domain characteristics of the signal, are typically computed directly by acoustic emission measurement systems and can be processed in real-time, even with technology from 40 years ago. However, research has shown that incorporating advanced features including the frequency domain can significantly improve model robustness and accuracy in applications like condition monitoring and structural health monitoring. Many of the features are directly inspired by research from fields such as vibration analysis, speech recognition, and music information retrieval."
